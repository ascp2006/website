<h3><span style="line-height: 2;color:White"> This is my 1.2.5 project Tic Tac Toe in Python. It ended up using a lot more lines of code than I thought Tic Tac Toe would take but we still finished the project well within time. My only complaint or dissatisfaction with the project is that I couldn't end up getting the Xs to draw exactly in the order that I wanted them to (started in the center of the X instead of top left or right like most people would draw an X). </span></h3>

<h2><span style="color:White"> Scratch Project Can Shooter </span><h2>

<img style="color:White" src="Images/csimg.PNG" alt="Can Shooter level 2" height="" width="">
<h3><span style="line-height: 2;color:White"> This is my Scratch project called Can Shooter. My partner came up with most of it and its execution is pretty similar to Duck Hunt. The main differences between it and Duck Hunt are that there can be multiple cans on screen at once and the background changes. Also the cans based on the background (or level) change size, speed, and how many are on your screen at once. </span></h3>
